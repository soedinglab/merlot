\arguments{
\item{ExpressionMatrix}{Gene expression matrix on which the tree will be embedded}

\item{ElasticTree}{elastic tree to be embedded on the gene expression space}

\item{lambda_0}{principal elastic tree energy function parameter.}

\item{mu_0}{principal elastic tree energy function parameter}

\item{increaseFactor_mu}{factor by which the principal elastic tree energy function parameters will be increased for the embedding}

\item{NCores}{number of CPU cores to be used for the calculation}
}
\description{
Embeds an elastic principal tree on the gene expression space from which the initial cell coordinates were calculated. The function receives the original Expression Matrix from which a lowe dimensional manifold was calculated and the coordinates from the low-dimensional manifold.
