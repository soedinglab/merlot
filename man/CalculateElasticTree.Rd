\description{
Calculates an elastic tree using a scaffold tree to initialize it. A set of N_yk nodes are included one byone into a tree structure that minimizes an error and an energetic functions to the cell coordinates. The initialization with the scaffold tree ensures that the correct number of endpoints and branchpoints and their connectivity are preserved in the elastic tree interpolation.
